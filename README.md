# Refactoring Horesion Webpage

## Description

The purpose of this project is to refactor the HTML and CSS files for a marketing agency's webpage so that it follows accessibility standards and is optimized for search engines. In this project, I learned how to refactor the HTML structure of an already built webpage with HTML semantic elements. I also learned that updating the HTML structure required altering the CSS style page linked to the HTML page simultaneously so that the webpage would continue to function as it did initially.

## Usage

To use my webpage you can open up the Horesion webpage in a browser on Google Chrome and inspect the code using the elements tab via Chrome DevTools. Once you navigate to the page you can right-click and select "inspect" to open up Chrome DevTools. On the elements tab, it can display the HTML structure and CSS styles associated with each HTML element and display refactored HTML structure of the webpage.
